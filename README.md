# Programming Studio 2 (COSC2804) - Assignment 2
This is the README file for Assignment 2 in Programming Studio 2 (COSC2804).

The LC-3 virtual machine contained herein is a modified fork of [this publically available repo](https://github.com/mhashim6/LC3-Virtual-Machine). You can browse the documentation for the original virtual machine [here](DOCS.md).

The VM has been modified to enable communication with Minecraft, via the MCPI library. If you're curious about how this has been done, see [traps.py](traps.py) (but please do not modify this file). The only files that you should edit are the *.asm files and problem_12.txt.
