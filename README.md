**Student number:** \*\*\*Please place your student number here\*\*\*

This is the README file for Assignment 2 in Programming Studio 2 (COSC2804).

The LC-3 virtual machine contained herein is a modified fork of [this publically available repo](https://github.com/mhashim6/LC3-Virtual-Machine). You can browse the documentation for the original virtual machine [here](DOCS.md).

The VM has been modified to enable communication with Minecraft, via the MCPI library. If you're curious about how this has been done, see [traps.py](traps.py), but please do not modify this file. The only files that you should modify are the *.asm files, problem_12.txt, and this README.md file (by adding your student number above).
