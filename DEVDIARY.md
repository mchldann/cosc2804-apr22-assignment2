Feel free to edit as you see fit e.g., based on your progress updates, hurdles encountered and overcome.
Make sure to log one comprehensive update per student, per each week of our teaching term.
Please, get in touch with teaching staff for any questions around this or otherwise post on Microsoft Teams.
